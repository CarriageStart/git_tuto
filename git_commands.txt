git log -all --decorate --oneline --graph

#   1. Change tracking
# Git reset
# - It can go forward or backward anyway if the commit is logged in git track.

git reset --hard (Hash of commit)
git reset --hard    # By default, tracks to the last commit in git track

#   2. Branching
git status  # You can check the current branch with this
# Add new branch
git branch (branch_name)    
# Switch branch
git switch (branch_name)    

# Add and switch at the same time
git switch -c (branch_name)
# Remove branch
git branch -d (branch_name)
git branch -D (branch_name) # If branch has commits which is not merged.//
# Rename branch
git branch -m (branch_name) (new_name)

#   3. Merging
# Merge
# Apply all commits of target branch on current branch
# The merge is logged in commit therefore revertable or resettable
# The target branch is not removed(still seperated)
git merge (target_branch)
# If you don't need the target branch, remove it
git branch -d (target_branch)

# rebase
# On current status of the current branch, apply the target branch commits
# Rebase the current branch with the target branch
# All commits of current branch is replaced to target branch
git rebase (target_branch)

# git
